# Clear_The_Clutter
This project automates file organization by categorizing files based on their extensions. It scans a specified directory, identifies files with different extensions, and moves them into separate folders named after their respective extensions. This helps in maintaining a structured and clutter-free workspace by grouping similar files together.
